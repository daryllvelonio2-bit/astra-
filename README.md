Your phone is a computer — **Astra** treats it like one. Instead of toy
editors or SSH-ing into a remote server, Astra runs a complete development
environment **on-device**: a real Alpine Linux userland embedded in the app,
a VS Code-style editor, a PTY terminal, a Git client, a browser preview, a
full Linux desktop, and a Gemini-powered coding agent that edits, runs, and
ships code alongside you.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 📝 **Editor** | Themed editing with syntax highlighting, diagnostics, formatting, virtualized large-file viewing, and a resizable file explorer with drag & drop |
| 🤖 **AI Agent** | Autonomous Gemini agent that builds features, fixes bugs, runs servers, and opens results in your editor — via fullscreen chat or a floating chathead |
| 💻 **Terminal** | Real PTY terminal (xterm.js) with Termux-class tooling, extra-keys row, themes, and multi-session tabs |
| 🌿 **Git** | GitHub-Desktop-style client: stage, AI-generated commit messages, branches, history, diffs, push/pull with token or SSH auth, one-tap repo cloning |
| 🌐 **Browser** | Live preview of your dev servers with port detection and navigation |
| 🖥️ **Desktop** | On-demand XFCE Linux desktop (VNC) for GUI tools, with landscape fullscreen |
| 📦 **Workspaces** | Sandboxed projects, custom directories anywhere on storage, dynamic per-platform paths |
| 🎨 **Personal** | Dark / Light / Midnight themes, switchable models, toggleable tabs and shortcuts |

## 🚀 Quick start

```sh
# first time: fetch Alpine rootfs + proot assets, bootstrap the toolchain
./setup-linux-assets.sh
./build-local-apk.sh

# daily loop: Metro in an external terminal, then install & launch
./start-debug.sh
```

> A physical Android device with USB debugging + a Gemini API key
> (Settings → Keys) is all you need. Full guide:
