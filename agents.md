# AI Agent Guidelines (`agent.md`)

**MANDATORY:** Read this file first before making any changes or generating code in this repository.

## Core Rules & Philosophy

1. **Zero Bloatware:** Avoid unnecessary UI boxes, overly complex components, verbose explanations, or fluff text. Keep interfaces clean, minimal, and direct.
2. **Simplicity First:** Prioritize straightforward implementations and intuitive workflows over over-engineered solutions.
3. **Scalable Architecture:** Design systems with clean separation of concerns, robust folder structures, and easy extensibility.
4. **Modular Code:** Break down features into small, reusable modules, services, and components.
5. **File Size Limit:** **No code file may exceed 500 lines.** If a file approaches or exceeds 500 lines, refactor and split it into smaller modules.
6. **Strict 1 Feature = 1 File Modularity:** Different feature scopes must reside in separate files to guarantee fault isolation.
7. **Strict User Instruction Adherence & Zero Hallucination:** Follow the user's explicit step-by-step instructions precisely. Never invent unrequested functionality or jump ahead without user guidance.
8. **Progress Tracking:** After every significant update, refactor, or feature addition, update `PROGRESS.md` with a summary of changes, current status, and date.
9. **Debug Mode Release & Deployment:** Always build, release, and deploy the application in **Debug mode** (`assembleDebug` / `build-debug-apk.sh` / `app-debug.apk`) to enable live developer inspection, fast incremental compilation, and active ADB reverse connection.
10. **Launch Debug Mode in Dedicated Terminal:** Always launch the Metro bundler development server in a separate, external terminal window (e.g. `foot`, `kitty`, or `xterm` via `start-debug.sh` / `metro.sh`) so live hot-reloading, bundling logs, and developer sessions run persistently in an independent window.
11. **Strict Global Theme Adherence:** All UI components, editors, terminals, and modals must strictly consume the global theme (`useTheme()`) and dynamic theme tokens. Never use hardcoded static colors that violate the user's active theme selection.
